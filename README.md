## Installation 💻

To get started with Hacxk-MD, follow these steps for various server environments:

## First, Obtain a Session 🔐

Visit the [Hacxk-MD Session Provider](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) and scan the QR code or enter the pairing code. Once completed, the session file will be sent to your paired WhatsApp number. Retrieve that session file.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> If you encounter an "Invalid QR Code" message while scanning, simply restart your NodeJS process.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If a Session folder doesn't exist in your bot, create one. Paste the session file into the created folder.

The next step is hosting.
